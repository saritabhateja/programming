/* for first 2 posts- diffways - k*(k-1)
                      sameways - k
   for 3rd post, we calculate diffways and sameways as follows:
    - if the previous 2 posts are of different colors, we may paint this post same as of that of previous color - diffways * 1
    - if the previous 2 posts are of different colors, we may stick to choose different color this time as well - diffways * (k-1)
    - if the previous 2 posts are of same colors, we have to choose different color other than the previous one - sameways * (k-1)
    hence, sameways = diffways
          diffways = (sameways + diffways) * (k-1)
           

class Solution {
    public int numWays(int n, int k) {
        if(n <= 0)
            return 0;
        if (n==1) return k;
        
        int diffways = k*(k-1);
        int sameways = k;
        
        for(int i=2; i<n; i++){
            int temp = diffways;                  
            diffways = (diffways + sameways) * (k-1);
            sameways = temp;
        }
        return diffways + sameways;
    }
}
